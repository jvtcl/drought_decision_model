\section{Indices}
Time is indexed by $t$, units in years. Variables with this index are allowed to vary by year.

Insurance decision is indexed by $i$, where $i=1$ corresponds to the purchase of insurance and $i=0$


\section{Profit Model}
\begin{equation}
\pi_t = R_t - C_t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Revenues}
\begin{equation}
R_t(h,\phi, w_t, p_t) = q_t (h,\phi, w_t) p_t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
q_t = \phi h * w_t
\end{equation}

Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $q_t$: Quantity of calves sold (pounds)
\item \(\phi\): Average percentage of calves sold, 
\item \(h\): herd size (number of cows, does not include calves), 
\item $w_t$: calf weight at weaning in year \(t\) (pounds), 
\item $p_t$: price of calves at weaning in year \(t\) (\$/pound)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
\begin{equation}
C_t = \gamma h + 
\end{equation}

Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\phi\): Average percentage of calves sold, 
\item \(h\): herd size (number of cows, does not include calves), 
\item $w_t$: calf weight at weaning in year \(t\) (pounds), 
\item $p_t$: price of calves at weaning in year \(t\) (\$/pound)
\item \(\gamma\): base operating costs (\$/cow)
\end{itemize}
