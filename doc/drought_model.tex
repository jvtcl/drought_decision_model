\section{Indices}
Time is indexed by $t$, units in years. Variables with this index are allowed to vary by year.

Insurance decision is indexed by $i$, where $i=1$ corresponds to the purchase of insurance and $i=0$

\section{Profit Model}
\begin{equation}
\pi_t = R_t - C_t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Revenues}
Base sales: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateExpSales! 
\item Inputs: \verb!herd, calf.sell, wn.wt, p.wn!
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation} \label{baserevenues}
R_{b,t}(h,\phi, w_t, p_t) = q_t (h,\phi, w_t) p_t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

\item $w_t$: calf weight at weaning in year \(t\) (pounds),  \verb!wn.wt!
\item $p_t$: price of calves at weaning in year \(t\) (\$/pound), \verb!p.wn!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
Total Cost Function:
\begin{equation}
C_t = baseC_t + iprem + adapt
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Base costs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateBaseOpCosts!
\item Inputs: \verb!herd, cow.cost!
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
baseC_t = \gamma h 
\end{equation}

Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(h\): herd size (number of cows, does not include calves), \verb!herd!
\item \(\gamma\): base operating costs (\$/cow), \verb!cow.cost!
\end{itemize}

\section{Drought Adaptation}
Drought Adaptation Options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Buy Feed
\item Rent Pasture
\item Sell Pairs and Replace
\item Do Nothing
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How much adaptation is needed?} Depends on the length of adaptation action ($\lambda$ = \verb!days.act!) and the intensity of the drought ($\alpha$ = \verb!forage.potential!). Different drought adaptation actions are scaled slightly differently to account for fixed costs (e.g., trucking) and variables costs (e.g., days of pasture rental). 

\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateDaysAction!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Calculate the number of days rancher pays for a drought adaptation action. NOTE: This function assumes that the actions take place only in one year.
	\item Inputs: \verb!act.st.yr! (year the action starts), \verb!act.st.m! (month the action starts), \verb!act.end.yr! (year the action ends), \verb!act.end.m! (month the action ends)
	\item Outputs: Number of days drought adaptation action takes place (days) (\verb!days.act!)
	\item Limitation: Not equipped to handle drought adaptation in multiple years. Currently only works for the first year (bug identified).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation} \label{days}
\lambda = \verb!days.act! = 30 * (\verb!act.end.m! - \verb!act.end.m!)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateAdaptationIntensity!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Takes forage potential and an adaptation intensity factor to provide a scalar of drought action. If forage potential is above 1 (no drought), then this variable goes to 0 (no adaptation). The variable has a maximum of 1, which assumes that drought actions are parameterized at full forage replacement for the full herd.
	\item Inputs: \verb!adpt.intensity.factor! = \(\psi\) (parameter that scales adaptation actions to reflect actual adaptation behavior. Currently defaults to 1 which assumes a one-to-one ratio of drops in forage percentage to need for forage replacement.), \verb!forage.potential! = \(\alpha\) (the percentage of average forage produced in a year based on rainfall. See forage potential functions.)
	\item Output: \verb!drght.act.adj! (scales action to account for forage potential's deviation from the norm.)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation} \label{intens}
\beta = \verb!drght.act.adj!=
\begin{cases}
\min\{1,(1-\alpha)*\psi)\} & \text{if}\ \alpha \le 0 \\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Drought Adaptation Option: Buy Feed}
\subsubsection{Costs}
In addition to base costs, $C_{b,t}$, with the buy feed adaptation option, we add the cost of buying feed according to the following function:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateFeedCost!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Calculating the costs of purchasing additional feed
	\item Inputs: \verb!hay.ration! (hay ration assuming no grazing (pounds/head/day) \textit{Source needed}), \verb!p.hay! (price of hay (\$/ton). user input), \verb!oth.ration! (ration of non-hay feed (pounds/head/day) \textit{Source needed}, \verb!p.oth! (price of other feed (\$/ton). User input. Does not come into play since the model assumes only feeding hay), $\beta$ = \verb!intens.adj! (drought intensity adjustment, eq. \ref{intens}), $\lambda$ = \verb!days.act! (days adaptation action (days), eq. \ref{days}), \verb!herd! = \(h\) (size of herd (head of cows, does not include calves))
	\item Outputs: \verb!cost.feed! (additional costs to feed the herd over the remainder of the season (\$/year))
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
C_{f,t} = \beta \lambda h \left(\frac{ration_{hay}}{2000} * p_{hay} + \frac{ration_{oth}}{2000} * p_{oth} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Revenues}
Revenues are unchanged from the base level. ( eq. \ref{baserevenues})
\begin{equation}
R_{f,t} = R_{b,t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Drought Adaptation: Rent Pasture}
\subsubsection{Costs}
In addition to base costs, we add the cost of renting pasture according to the following function:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculatePastureRentCost!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Calculates the costs of renting pasture and trucking pairs
	\item Inputs: $m$ = \verb!n.miles! (distance to rented pasture (miles)), $p_{truck}$ = \verb!truck.cost! (trucking cost per loaded mile (\$/mile/truck)), $p_{rent}$ = \verb!past.rent! (price of renting pasture per animal unit month, where an animal unit is a cow/calf pair (\$/pair/month)), $\beta$ = \verb!intens.adj! (portion of herd moving to rented pasture), $\lambda$ = \verb!days.act! (days on rented pasture(days), $C_{fixed}$ = \verb!oth.cost! (all other non-rental, non-trucking costs (\$)), $w_{max}$ = \verb!max.wt! (maximum weight per truck (pounds)), $w_cow$ = \verb!cow.wt! (average cow weight (pounds)), $w_{calf}$ = \verb!calf.wt! (average 'current' weight of calves before trucking to rented pasture (pounds)), $h$ =\verb!herd! (size of herd (head of cows, does not include calves))
	\item Output: \verb!cost.rentpast! (total costs of using renting pasture including transport costs on top of normal operating costs (\$/year))
	\item Assumptions: Only cows are trucked back home. Fixed costs cover transaction costs (time, etc.) of arranging pasture rental.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Number of trucks needed to transport portion of herd (pairs) to rented pasture:
\begin{equation}
n_{to} = \lceil \beta h * \lceil w_{max} / (w_{cow} + w_{calf}) \rceil \rceil
\end{equation}
Number of trucks needed to transport portion of herd (cows only) back to home pasture:
\begin{equation}
n_{from} = \lceil \beta h * \lceil w_{max} / w_{cow} \rceil \rceil
\end{equation}

Cost of hiring trucks:
\begin{equation}
C_{trucks} =  m * p_{truck} (n_{to} + n_{from})
\end{equation}

Cost of renting pasture:
\begin{equation}
C_{rent} = \beta \lambda h  \frac{p_{rent}}{30} 
\end{equation}

Total cost of ranching operation with drought adaptation through rental pasture:
\begin{equation}
C_{r,t} = C_{trucks} + C_{rent} + C_{fixed} + C_{base}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Revenues}
Due to losses during the stress of trucking cows and calves, the revenues are lower than normal.

\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!CalculateRentPastRevenue!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Calculates calf sale revenues after trucking pairs to rented pastures
	\item Inputs: \verb!calf.loss! (additional calf deaths due to transport stress (head of calves)), \verb!calf.wt.adj! (adjustment for calf weaning weights (\%)), \verb!calf.sell! (average percentage of calves sold (\%)), \verb!wn.wt! (average weight at weaning (pounds)), \verb!p.wn! (expected sale price of calves (\$/pound)), \verb!herd! (size of herd (head of cows, does not include calves)), $\beta$ = \verb!intens.adj! (portion of herd moving to rented pasture)
  \item Outputs: \verb!rev.rentpast! (change in revenue due to mortality and weight loss from trucking to rented pasture)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}	 

  Number of calves sold after accounting for calf mortality in transport 
  calf.sales.rent <- herd * intens.adj * calf.sell - calf.loss
  calf.sales.home <- herd * (1 - intens.adj) * calf.sell
  
 Selling weight after accounting for weight loss due to transport stress
  sell.wt.rent <- expected.wn.wt * (1 + calf.wt.adj)
  
 Expected calf sale revenues
  rev.rentpast <- p.wn * (calf.sales.rent * sell.wt.rent + calf.sales.home * expected.wn.wt)

Option "autoSelect.insurance":
\begin{itemize}
\item Function: \verb!insAlloc!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Automates range insurance allocation to two-month RMA intervals using a grid cell/COOP site's forage potential weights. Returns a matrix formatted as the `insPurchase` input for function `insMat`. Allocation for chosen two-month intervals is roughly proportional to the relative value of each interval's forage potential weight. Adjustments to allocation percentages are automatically made if a selection is invalid for one or more intervals, either too high ($>$60\%) or too low (10\%). User-specified min/max allocation percentages falling within this range may also be substituted by setting the `max.alloc` and `min.alloc` arguments.
	\item Inputs: \verb!fpwt! (A vector of monthly forage potential weights for the target site. Monthly intervals are averaged to two-month intervals to match RMA insurance selections.), \verb!niv! (number of two-month intervals to insure), \verb!by.rank! (if TRUE (default), ranks forage potential weights by interval in descending order and selects the `niv` most highly ranked non-consecutive intervals to insure. If FALSE, selects the combination of `niv` non-consecutive two-month intervals with the highest average forage potential weights.), \verb!max.alloc!  (maximum interval allocation, 0.6), \verb!min.alloc! (minimum interval allocation, 0.1).
	\item Outputs: 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\begin{itemize}	
\item Helper Function: \verb!dcInfo! (extracts drought calculator information from a grid cell), inputs: \verb!dc! (drought calculator output), \verb!tgrd! (target grid cell id)
